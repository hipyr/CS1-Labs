The C and C++ compilers are integrated; g++ is a script to call gcc with options to recognize C++. gcc processes input files through one or more stages.  In general g++ program.cpp or g++ program.C will cause the gcc to create an executable file as a.out. This file can be run to produce the output from the program.  The g++ command on some machines is  replaced with CC.  In either case, the g++ or CC command will call the gcc compiler.
